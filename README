SQLWebProxySharp
================

SQLWebProxySharp is a simple web server using the .NET HttpListener. Its sole purpose is to proxy SQL queries over a local network to a MySQL instance running on the same server.

There is currently no security mechanism, so I strongly recommend to NOT use this over a public network.
