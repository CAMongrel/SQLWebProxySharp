SQLWebProxySharp
================

SQLWebProxySharp is a simple web server using the .NET HttpListener. Its sole purpose is to proxy SQL queries over a local network to a MySQL instance running on the same server.

There is currently no security mechanism, so I strongly recommend to NOT use this over a public network.


Reasoning
=========

This project is written for a Metro style application. Since Metro apps can't access MySQL servers directly, I was in need for something different to allow my Metro app access to the MySQL backend.


TODO
====

 - Use serialization for request and response
 - Implement security mechanisms
