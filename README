SQLWebProxySharp
================

SQLWebProxySharp will be a simple web server using the .NET HttpListener. Its sole purpose will be to proxy SQL queries over a local network to a MySQL instance running on the same server.

There is currently no security mechanism, so I strongly recommend to NOT use this over a public network.

TODO
====
 - Use serialization for request and response
 - Implement security mechanisms
